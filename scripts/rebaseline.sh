# A re-baseline is legitimate when the environment is deliberately changed — a
# new tlnet snapshot, a different font package set, an edit to
# src/style/contex-*.sty — and NOT
# as a way to make a failing verification pass. If you did not intend to change
# typeset output, a re-baseline is the wrong tool: find out why the output moved.

This overwrites the golden PDF that the acceptance test compares against.
If the verification is failing and you did not deliberately change the
environment, this is not the fix — diagnose the change instead (AGENTS.md §9).

Machine-readable record of the golden fixture and the environment that produced
it. \`scripts/verify-fixture.sh\` reads every expected value from here, so this
file and \`fixture.pdf\` are only ever updated together, by
\`scripts/rebaseline.sh\` (AGENTS.md §8).

### Debian package versions

image/Dockerfile names these packages but does not pin their versions, so a cold
rebuild resolves them against whatever Debian serves that day. These are the
versions that produced this baseline.
